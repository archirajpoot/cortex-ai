## 🚀 Overview
**Cortex-AI** is a high-fidelity Reinforcement Learning environment designed for the **Meta OpenEnv 2026 Hackathon**. Unlike traditional support bots, Cortex-AI implements a **Triple-Check Cognitive Architecture** that allows an AI agent to perform multi-step reasoning across sentiment, financial impact, and personalized resolution logic.

### 💎 Key Features
*   **Triple-Check Reasoning**: Qualitative audit of every decision (Sentiment, Finance, Personalization).
*   **Dynamic Efficiency Scoring**: Real-time ROI comparison between AI resolution and manual human ceiling.
*   **Premium Glassmorphic UI**: A state-of-the-art Gradio dashboard designed for executive-level visibility.
*   **Context-Aware Episodes**: Multi-step customer interactions with persistent memory and evolving sentiment.
*   **OpenEnv Standardized**: Fully compliant with the OpenEnv Gymnasium-style RL framework.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
Cortex-AI utilizes a unified **FastAPI + Gradio** stack to serve both the RL environment and the management dashboard on a single exposure port.
